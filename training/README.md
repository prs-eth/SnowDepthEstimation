# Training

An example script that runs the proposed two-stage training of the network for snow depth estimation can be found in ``train_and_finetune.sh``.

Note that this uses a dummy dataloader and is provided with the purpose of understanding the proposed method and applying it to other data, rather than reproducing the results reported in the original paper.

Additional code which is not used in this dummy run is also provided.
